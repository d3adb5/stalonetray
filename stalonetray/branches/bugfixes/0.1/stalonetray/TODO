* Make satray survive even if window suddenly dissapears
  (during some operation, when destroy\unmap was not handled)
* Find out what's the problem with kde dockapps (they add\remove
  their icon several times). Is it a bug in kdetrayproxy or not?
  Need some workarounds...
* Debug output redirection
