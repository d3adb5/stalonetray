+ Each icon must have a newly created parent window, which matches its
  dimentions (for ease of move and for them to be centered ?). 
+ Anvanced grow
+ Reorganize settings (and vars)  
- Make use of resources (WONTDO)
+ rc file
+ Need to handle unusual sizes of "icons" (and resolve when to force
  constraints)
* Full XEMBED implementation (?)
+ Make satray survive even if window suddenly dissapears
  (during some operation, when destroy\unmap was not handled)
+/- KDE tray implementation (solves previous problem)
- Handle tray resize
- Handle tray icon move/resize
+ Simplify rc file syntax/re-reorganize settings
+ main.c cleanup
