+ Each icon must have a newly created parent window, which matches its
  dimentions (for ease of move and for them to be centered ?). 
+ Anvanced grow
+ Reorganize settings (and vars)  
- Make use of resources (WONTDO)
+ rc file
+ Need to handle unusual sizes of "icons" (and resolve when to force
  constraints)
+ Make satray survive even if window suddenly dissapears
  (during some operation, when destroy\unmap was not handled)
+ KDE tray implementation (solves previous problem)
+ Handle tray icon move/resize
+ Simplify rc file syntax/re-reorganize settings
+ main.c cleanup 
+ update transparent/parent background on icon move/resize
+ review DBG() calls in accordance with doc/DEBUG-LEVELS
+ reacquire tray selection after loss (if holder exits) (update sample rc(done))
+ find and fix typos
+ fix (almost all) warnings with -Wall
+ .spec file for building rpms
+ man page
+ tray grow with wnd deco

for 0.4
+ default values in the manpage, MWM/EWMH compliancy must be noted
- ontop/onbottom/normal (wnd_layer param)
- *wm tests (pwm(2), e17 have some issues)
- xorg7 build troubles
+ more flexible wnd deco specification
? make use of ewmh spec (_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER, _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK and friends)
- all configure.in needs review (refuse to build if something goes wrong)


for 0.5
- wmaker mode
- code cleanuo (again :()
- Full XEMBED implementation (?)
