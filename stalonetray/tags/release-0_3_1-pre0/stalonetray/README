			STAnd aLONE TRAY


Description: the stalonetray is a STAnd-aLONE system TRAY (notification area).
It has minimal build and run-time dependencies: the Xlib only. The XEMBED
support is planned. Stalonetray runs under virtually any window manager.

To start using stalonetray, just copy stalonetrayrc.sample to ~/.stalonetrayrc.
It is well-commented and should suffice for a quick start.

Build-deps: Xlib, libc, cc. 

License: GPL (see COPYING). 

Reporting bugs: If you have found a bug: try to reproduce it with debug level
set to 8 (cf stalonetray --help and/or stalonetrayrc.sample) and send the log
file to me.

How to help: see TODO file and TODOs, XXXs and FIXMEs in sources if you want to.
