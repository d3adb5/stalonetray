+ Each icon must have a newly created parent window, which matches its
  dimentions (for ease of move and for them to be centered ?). 
+ Anvanced grow
+ Reorganize settings (and vars)  
- Make use of resources (WONTDO)
+ rc file
+ Need to handle unusual sizes of "icons" (and resolve when to force
  constraints)
+ Make satray survive even if window suddenly dissapears
  (during some operation, when destroy\unmap was not handled)
+ KDE tray implementation (solves previous problem)
+ Handle tray icon move/resize
+ Simplify rc file syntax/re-reorganize settings
+ main.c cleanup 
+ update transparent/parent background on icon move/resize
+ review DBG() calls in accordance with doc/DEBUG-LEVELS
+ reacquire tray selection after loss (if holder exits) (update sample rc(done))
+ find and fix typos
+ fix (almost all) warnings with -Wall
+ .spec file for building rpms
+ man page
+ tray grow with wnd deco

for 0.4
+ default values in the manpage, MWM/EWMH compliancy must be noted
+ ontop/onbottom/normal (wnd_layer param)
+ xorg7 build troubles
+ more flexible wnd deco specification
+ make use of ewmh spec (_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER, _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK and friends)
+ all configure.in needs review (refuse to build if something goes wrong)
+ update DBG so that it does not require C99
+ *wm tests (pwm(2), e17 have some issues):
	+ WMaker (everything works)
	+ Fvwm (for sure)
	+ PWM(1) (no_{title,border} do not work)
	+ E17 (the same =()
+ something has happened to vertical layout (all works)
+ tests on sf cf
	+ now stalonetray can be build with Sun ONE 8 C compiler =) (because it's sources conform to C90 specs)
