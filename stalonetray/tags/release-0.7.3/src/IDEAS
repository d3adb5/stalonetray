+ send a message after embedding for confirmation
+ add_icon -> allocate_icon, del_icon -> deallocate_icon
+ is_something for props
+ remove mid-parent from layout, it does not belong there
+ add_icon, remove_icon, show_icon, hide_icon
+ track _XEMBED_INFO (add icons as hidden, if _XEMBED_INFO & XEMBED_MAPPED == 0)
+ collect kde icons at startup unconditionally
+ at startup mark all kde icons which have non-root parent as non-collectable 
+ get icon geometry from normal size hints
+ get rid of tray_check_grow and friends: use grid_max_size instead
+ xembed info data should be the part of icon data, so that xembed_check_support wont query wnd properties twice
- make parsing utilites accept lists of targets, may be implemented via void **.
- recalc. grid size while handling icon resize
- placement search code needs review
- choose_best_placement: grid size changes have higher priority than window size
- instead of setting exit flag, send self an exit mesage (will this work _inside_ sighandler?)
