+ too much focus changes in tray-test-gtk
+ gtk icons try 32x32 size first. But sometimes, they resize themselves _after_ they were reparented...
+ WHO BROKE XEMBED IMPLEMENTATION ?!!!
- use circular list for icons? (WHY?!)
+ property sizes can vary... we need a way to know the size of the prop. on the server...
+ ti->is_invalid is in many random places. that's bad, need to fix this
+ optinal parameters are broken ?
+ breaks on workrave 
+ icon repaint is broken (now there's too much flicker)
+ implement clipping in background update routine
+ bg is not updated on wallp change with -p mode
+ icons are invisible unless they are forced to be redrawn...
+ rethink cleanup code usage; things like cleanup(); exit(0); should be removed.
+ hangs during exit (during XSync: must deside when do not call it)
+ help message is not in sync with the available commands
+ stdint is not available everywhere (replaced with CARD8/CARD16/CARD32)
+ strange behaviour while re-acquiring activity
+ wazzup with klipper?
+ default gravities
+ vertical mode
+ remove_icon + shrink_back is broken ?
+ failed to update background on wallp. change (e17 is to blame: no root pmap property)
- break long string in usage() 
- grow issues (in 0.8) (seems like FVWM/(xserver?) bug, documented in BUGS, KLUDGE developed, to be resolved later)
